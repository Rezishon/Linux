Server:

    Check ssh version by: 
        ssh -V (if it returns number ssh is installed already unless we should install it)

    Start SSH:
        sudo systemctl start ssh

    Create config file:
        sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config(Then add these lines):
        ! File is available in ./Config_Files/

            Port 2200
            HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
            HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
            HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key

            X11DisplayOffset 10

    Reload SSH:
        sudo systemctl reload ssh

Client: 
        Create SSH Key:
            ssh-keygen -t rsa

        Check if the key has created:
            cd ~/.ssh
            ls -l
            (The rsa file should be available)
        
        Transfer public key to server:
            ssh-copy-id [remote_host]
